# Description
This application is very easy to use. Do you want to download audio file or video file without annoying website full of ads? You have found out the right choice xD.
You search on youtube the video you want to download and copy the Url (the odd words at the top of the page, for example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), select the type of video you want and press Download.
